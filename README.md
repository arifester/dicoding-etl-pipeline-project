# Dicoding ETL Pipeline Project
This project serves as the final submission for Dicoding's *Learn Data Processing Fundamentals* course, aimed at constructing a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to monitor competitor product data.
Built with Python, the system leverages `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the Fashion Studio website, followed by `pandas` for rigorous data cleaning and regex-based standardization.The processed data is then automatically loaded into three distinct storage solutions: local CSV files, Google Sheets, and PostgreSQL.
By strictly adhering to modular code principles and achieving high test coverage with `pytest`, this project ensures a reliable data workflow optimized for business insights.
